/**
 * Create 3D Secure payment (SOAP)
 * 
 * 3D Secure (Verifed by VISA / MasterCard SecureCode™) is an additional authentication
 * protocol that involves the shopper being redirected to their card issuer where their
 * identity is authenticated prior to the payment proceeding to an authorisation request.
 * 
 * In order to start processing 3D Secure transactions, the following changes are required:
 * 1. Your Merchant Account needs to be confgured by Adyen to support 3D Secure. If you would
 *    like to have 3D Secure enabled, please submit a request to the Adyen Support Team (support@adyen.com).
 * 2. Your integration should support redirecting the shopper to the card issuer and submitting
 *    a second API call to complete the payment.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the initial API call to create the 3D secure payment using SOAP,
 * and shows the redirection the the card issuer.
 * See the API Manual for a full explanation of the steps required to process 3D Secure payments.

 /**
  * A payment can be submitted by sending a PaymentRequest to the authorise action of the web service.
  * The initial API call for both 3D Secure and non-3D Secure payments is almost identical.
  * However, for 3D Secure payments, you must supply the browserInfo object as a sub-element of the payment request.
  * This is a container for the acceptHeader and userAgent of the shopper's browser.
  * 
  * The request should contain the following variables:
  * 
  * - merchantAccount           : The merchant account for which you want to process the payment
  * - amount
  *     - currency              : The three character ISO currency code.
  *     - value                 : The transaction amount in minor units (e.g. EUR 1,00 = 100).
  * - reference                 : Your reference for this payment.
  * - shopperIP                 : The shopper's IP address. (recommended)
  * - shopperEmail              : The shopper's email address. (recommended)
  * - shopperReference          : An ID that uniquely identifes the shopper, such as a customer id. (recommended)
  * - fraudOffset               : An integer that is added to the normal fraud score. (optional)
  * - card
  *     - expiryMonth           : The expiration date's month written as a 2-digit string,
  *                               padded with 0 if required (e.g. 03 or 12).
  *     - expiryYear            : The expiration date's year written as in full (e.g. 2016).
  *     - holderName            : The card holder's name, as embossed on the card.
  *     - number                : The card number.
  *     - cvc                   : The card validation code, which is the CVC2 (MasterCard),
  *                               CVV2 (Visa) or CID (American Express).
  *     - billingAddress (recommended)
  *         - street            : The street name.
  *         - houseNumberOrName : The house number (or name).
  *         - city              : The city.
  *         - postalCode        : The postal/zip code.
  *         - stateOrProvince   : The state or province.
  *         - country           : The country in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format (e.g. NL).
  * - browserInfo
  *     - userAgent             : The user agent string of the shopper's browser (required).
